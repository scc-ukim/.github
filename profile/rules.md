## Rules

As an organization we also have our own rules, that each member need to abide to, any violation will be `dealt internally`, but if the violation kept happends we will _not hasitate to pursue any legal action_.

### Repositories-related Rules

With that being said we are implementing these rules for repositories:

- Each team must name their repository follow these rules:
  - Each repository must start with team code (`wd` or `ds`).
  - Use `-` to seperated team code with the repository name.
  - Naming convention for repository name is `organization-projectname` ex. `ukim-websitekampus`
- Only the team with the proper naming can push any change to relative repository or you need to ask permission from the team leader before you do any changes.
- Any project that are **`secretive`** in nature are forbid to be public it must kept as private repository.
- Its `advice to fork the repo`, instead of directly pushing any changes to main repo ([SCC's Repo](https://github.com/scc-ukim)).
